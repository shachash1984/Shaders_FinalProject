Maps are used to provide information about a specific graphic quality by eliminating irrelevant details

Normal map: shows higher areas in white and lower areas in blue (true for each pixel in the texture)

Bump map: uses grayscale values of an image to create variations in pixel positions of the texture

Reflection map: used to represent a reflection of the surrounding environment of the texture
